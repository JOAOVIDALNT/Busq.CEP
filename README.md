<h1 align="center"> REACT Busq.CEP PROJECT </h1>

<p> My first react project where I follow an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oy4cbqE1_qc&t=1350s">youtube</a> guide. I've made some changes in the project to be more authentic </p>

## Changes that I made:

#     #JavaScript
- add a event listenner for "Enter" key to search instead of only search by click

#      #Design
- adapt root font-size to use rem as global on CSS
- change color and size at most part of the project
- adapt animation settings
- adapt @media query to be fluid
